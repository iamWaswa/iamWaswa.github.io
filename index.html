                        As you probably already know my name is Waswa. 
                        I'm a CompSci major at Simon Fraser University, Vancouver. 
                        My story is one with many twists and turns but ultimately left me somewhere I belong: code.
                    </p>

                    <p class="page__paragraph">
                        I come from Kenya, a small country in East Africa where the most advanced thing I did with a computer was use Microsoft Access.
                        I got quite good at it actually, but now I can't even tell you how to create a query.
                    </p>

                    <p class="page__paragrpah">
                        Anywho, I was always good at math all through school and it was my favourite subject. 
                        Yeah, I was a major geek. 
                        And from the culture I grew up in there were two main paths I could take: Either become an engineer or an accountant.
                        My parents were both accountants and essentially what they told me about the job didn't appeal to me.
                        So engineering was my future. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="page__paragraph">
                        Through a long and emotionally charged process I ended up not going to the UK where I had always dreamt of going.
                        I found myself in Canada and thought that life was about to go downhill from there. So I thought...
                    </p>

                    <p class="page__paragrpaph">
                        I took my first programming class ever in semester one and I instantly fell in love with code!
                        You know the cliché story that goes, "It was after his first 'Hello World', that he fell in love with code..."
                        Well my story was that and more. 
                        I soon transferred into the Software Systems major which primarily focuses on bringing up software developers fit for the tech industry.
                        I literally could not stop building and developing. 
                        I had found my passion and I was not going to stop exploring it!
                    </p>

                    <p class="page__paragraph">
                        That brings me to today, where my love for code is greater than ever. 
                        My story is always a reminder of the gift that I received when I first got into programming.
                        I can't wait to create even more amazing things with software!
